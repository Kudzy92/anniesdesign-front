Two generous drawers provide all the storage you need for those night-time essentials, leaving you with some gorgeously smooth surface space that you’ll hardly want to cover up.  \n\n \n\nThe pedestal is constructed from solid Acacia wood – a dense hardwood with exceptional durability – and covered with Acacia wood veneers that provide a superior aesthetic and protect the wood from expanding or splitting due to temperature variance - ensuring it’ll last you for decades. The wire brush technique works beautifully to bring out the unique grain of this wood, while giving it a slightly weathered look that will hide any accidental scratches. \n\n \n\nThe pedestal is the ideal complement to pair with the Vancouver Acacia Wood Bed, made to just the right height, while providing a well-balanced design overall. Add the Vancouver Chest of Drawers or Storage Box to round off your bedroom, or get the best value with the Vancouver Full Bedroom Combo.    \n\n ",
